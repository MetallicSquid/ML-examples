# Rock-paper-scissors game with camera controls

## ToDo:
* camera_ui			-	This could be a tkinter window in which there are 3 buttons (rock, paper, scissors). The user presses these buttons and a picture is taken. Once enough pictures are taken, this becomes the dataset that the neural network is trained on.
* build_model			-	Build a neural network on the samples that were taken, very similar to the digit classifier one.
* evaluate_accuracy		-	Almost identicle to the last one, just to see how well the model performs.
* rock_paper_scissors_ui	-	A rock, paper, scissors game that takes pictures as the inputs.

Just ask if you have any questions.
