# Snake game with voice controls

I think we should do this in a similar way to last time.

## ToDo:
* voice_ui		-	This could be a tkinter window in which there are 4 buttons (up, down, left, right). The user presses these buttons and the user can say either up, down, left or right. Once enough samples are taken, this becomes the dataset that the neural network is trained on.
* build_model		-	Build a neural network on the samples that were taken, very similar to the digit classifier one.
* evaluate_accuracy	-	Almost identical to the last one, just to see how well the model performs.
* snake_ui		-	A snake game that takes the samples as the directional inputs



Just ask if you have any questions.
