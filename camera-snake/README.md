# Snake game with camera controls

Ariel's project.

I think we should do this in a similar way to last time.

## ToDo:
* gesture_ui		-	This could be a tkinter window in which there are 4 buttons (up, down, left, right). The user presses these buttons and pictures are taken. Once enough pictures are taken, this becomes the dataset that the neural network is trained on.
* build_model		-	Build a neural network on the pictures that were taken, very similar to the digit classifier one.
* evaluate_accuracy	-	Almost identical to the last one, just to see how well the model performs.
* snake_ui		-	A snake game that takes the gestures as the directional inputs



Just ask if you have any questions.
